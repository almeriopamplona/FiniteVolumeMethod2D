# Finite Volume Method - 2D
That is the result of the project for the computational fluid dynamics discipline in a master's program. The project aimed to model the lid-driven cavity, and the heat conduction on plate problems, using the finite volume method. Due to the limited time, one used Python to implement the numerical solutions. However, they have a relatively good performance. Furthermore, one tried to build the codes to be comprehensible, but for any problem, feel free to contact me (almeriopamplona@gmail.com).

I did some validations that I compiled in these papers:
